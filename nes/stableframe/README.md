**This demo shows mid-frame IRQs to create 32 colored rows, each four scanlines apart, without using a
mapper. Each row modifies the color emphasis bits as well as scroll.** Instructions:

1. Press A to synchronize and start mid-frame interrupts.
2. Press left and right buttons to shift the timer (for debugging).
3. Press B to desync.

This code should be able to be adapted for your game. The demo was motivated by the
[NESDev Compo 2022](https://itch.io/jam/nesdev-2022), as the "Games" category doesn't allow any
mappers that provide scanline-based IRQ support. This demo's header does not specify a mapper
(NROM) and has been tested in FCEUX, Mesen, and a front-loader NES (USA/NTSC).

You may need to install the [AS Macroassembler](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/) to build
via `make`.


## Theory

The NES doesn't provide a native timer capability to issue interrupts at different points in the
frame (to perform raster effects / update graphics mid-frame).
Usually you have to resort to using a mapper to get the capability to perform changes on particular
scanlines, or use wasteful/inflexible techniques like polling for sprite 0 hit.

But if your game doesn't use the
[APU's DMC channel](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/APU_DMC#Usage_of_DMC_for_syncing_to_video) to play
audio samples, you can play a silent sample, manually synchronize
the DMC's timer to the frame, and use the DMC IRQ (when a sample is finished) to interrupt your code
at precise points during rendering.

A strategy suggested by [NESDev forum user supercat](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=18854) 
is to change the DMC frequency more than once during an interrupt to allow for more precise timing.
Essentially, the DMC timer is always running, and you can influence when the DMC fires by using
different combinations of DMCFREQ values during its 8-bit sequence. If you combine rates in a
certain way, you can synchronize it with a particular CPU cycle and trigger an interrupt
exactly when you want during a frame.

The poster also suggests that you kick off another DMC sample each interrupt. This means the IRQ
sequence never terminates—initial synchronization is only required once, and the IRQ sequence itself
(and subsequent rate changes) are enough to keep the frame in-sync. This is the approach used by
this demo, since by only synchronizing at the start of the "level" we can minimize the CPU cycles
stolen from the main thread to maintain mid-frame raster effects.


## How it works

The demo works in two parts.

**Pre-sync:**

1. When you load the game, DMC is disabled. NMI is also disabled (and unused).
2. When you press the A button, we enter `dmc_sync.asm`. The game first tries to synchronize to a
   consistent PPU frame (with a routine copied from
   blargg's [full palette demo](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Full_palette_demo)). This may take a few
   blank frames to sync. The timer ends on a known PPU frame and shortly before VBLANK, leaving
   time for the next step.
3. Next we synchronize the DMC timer. Because the timer could at this point be anywhere in its
   initial 54*8 cycle sample period, we measure this delay using a page-aligned series of `nop`s and
   the program counter. Once the DMC IRQ fires, we grab the measured delay from the low byte of the
   program counter.
4. Finally we compensate for the measured delay by changing the DMC frequency four times in a single
   interrupt, to synchronize the DMC timer to a consistent CPU cycle. This sequence uses a lookup
   table stored in `dmc_sync_table.asm` (generated by `gen_dmc_sync_table.py`). The index will be a
   value from $00 to $d8 (aka 54*8 divided by two, because the DMC clock ticks every two CPU cycles
   and the `nop` counter can only measure every two CPU cycles). The "DMA sync" value is also
   displayed on-screen after you sync.

**Post-sync:**

1. From this point on, the next IRQ that fires will happen at the start of scanline 241, during
   VBLANK. This is the first entry in `irq_routines_table.asm` (generated by
   `gen_irq_routines_table.py`), and can serve the same purpose as NMI to perform writes to the PPU
   during VBLANK.
2. Each successive interrupt executes one of the entries in `irq_routines.asm`. Some of these
   routines just set the next DMC frequency, but others can create visual effects such as changing
   the background color or modifying scroll.
3. At the end of the IRQ routines table, we have four branches; because NTSC frames are 29780.5
   cycles long, four frames with different offsets (+1.5 cycles, -0.5, -0.5, and -0.5) are needed to
   keep the number of cycles over time consistent. This introduces some jitter, which is hidden in
   HBLANK. Note that the firing of an IRQ can be delayed by what's
   happening on the main loop; we stuff some 7-cycle opcodes in there to test worst case jitter.
4. We then loop back the first entry in the table. From now on, the frame should be stable. Code can
   execute on the main loop as well as via IRQ routines until you choose to desync. At any time, you
   can press B to desync and go back to the beginning, to try syncing with different DMC delays.
   This demonstrates transitioning between different IRQ sequences in your game, for example exiting
   a level to go to a menu.

And that's it. To customize this demo for your game, start by modifying `gen_irq_routines_table.py`
to design one or multiple interrupt sequences, and build your custom routines in `irq_routines.asm`
for custom raster logic.

## Mesen Sync Stress Test Script

To stress test synchronization and learn more how it works, you can have Mesen retry a bunch of
different measured DMC delays in the `dmu_sync_table`. Loading `mesen_sync_stress_test.lua` script
will randomly hit the A, B, and reset buttons, triggering the DMC sync at different sync offsets
over time.

The dialog will appear whenever DMC sync occurs. The script checks that the program fires its first
post-sync IRQ on scanline 240 at a PPU cycle of 338 or 339. If the demo ever syncs inconsistently, a
breakpoint is fired. The exact instruction being observed is the `jmp` trampoline stored in
`zp_irq_jmp`, which jumps to the first IRQ routine at the start of scanline 241.
