An NES demo implementing supercat's [strategy for DMC-driven
IRQs](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=18854) by changing DMC frequency mid-interrupt.

This demo shows mid-frame IRQs to create 32 colored rows, each four scanlines apart, without using a
mapper. It was tested in FCEUX, Mesen, and a front-loader NES (USA/NTSC).

This demo should be able to be adapted for your game. It was motivated for use in the
[NESDev Compo 2022](https://itch.io/jam/nesdev-2022), as the "Games" category doesn't allow any
mappers that provide scanline-based IRQ support.


## How it works

The NES doesn't provide a native timer capability to issue interrupts at different points in the
frame (to perform raster effects / update graphics mid-frame).
Usually you have to resort to using a mapper to get the capability to do per-scanline IRQs.

But if your game doesn't use APU's DMC channel to play audio samples, you can manually synchronize
the DMC's timer to the frame, and use the DMC IRQ (when a sample is finished) as your mid-frame
timer.

A strategy suggested by [NESDev forum user supercat](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=18854) 
is to change the DMC frequency mid-interrupt to allow for more precise timing. They also suggest to
keep triggering the DMC sample fetch each interrupt—meaning the IRQ sequence never terminates—so
that initial synchronization is only requierd once (presumably occurring right before loading a game
level).

The demo works as follows:

1. When you load the game, DMC is disabled. NMI is also disabled (and unused).
2. When you press the A button, the game first tries to synchronize to a consistent PPU frame. (Copied from
   blargg's [full palette demo](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Full_palette_demo)) This may take a few
   blank frames to sync.
3. Next we synchronize the DMC timer. Because the timer delay could be at any point in the 54*8
   cycle sample period, we measure this delay using the program counter and a bunch of `nop`s. Once
   the IRQ fires, we change the DMC frequency four different times in the first interrupt, to
   synchronize the timer to a consistent cycle.
4. At this point, the next IRQ that fires will happen at the start of scanline 241, during VBLANK.
   This is the first entry in `irq_routines_table`, and can serve the same purpose as NMI to set up
   your game.
5. Each interrupt from now on does a lookup in the `irq_routines_table` (generated by a Python
   script) for interrupt logic. Some interrupts just set the next DMC cycle, but they can create
   visual effects such as changing the background color or modifying scroll.
6. At the end of the table there are four branches; because NTSC frames are 29780.5 cycles long, we
   need four frames with different offsets (+1.5 cycles, -0.5, -0.5, and -0.5) to make sure the
   frame is stable. This jitter is hidden in HBLANK. (Note that IRQ can be delayed by what's
   happening on the main loop; we stuff some 7-cycle opcodes in there to test worst case jitter.)
7. From now on, the frame should be stable. You can press B at any time to disable the IRQ chain
   and go back to step #1, to try different sync delays.

And that's it. To customize this for your game, start with modifying `gen_irq_routines_table.py` and
build your custom routines in `irq_routines.asm`.

**NOTE:** The initial DMC synchronization may not be perfect. Very rarely, bugs appear during
repeated re-syncs in Mesen and FCEUX. But when correctly synchronized, the frame seems to be stable
for upwards of several days running on my NES.
